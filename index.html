      <p>A black cat is a domestic cat with black fur. They may be a specific breed, or a common domestic cat of no particular or mixed breed. Most black cats have golden irises due to their high melanin pigment content. Black cats are the subject of myth, legend, and superstition. They are often associated with witches and good or bad luck in European folklore.</p>
      <p>“White is an interesting lack of pigmentation; it’s not a color,” says Teresa Keiger, a Cat Fanciers’ Association (CFA) all-breed judge. There’s a gene called KIT, and the W form of KIT suppresses melanin, adds Dr. Hannah Hart, DVM, veterinary consultant for Chewy. The W gene can be recessive or dominant; the lucky genes and their combination determine if a cat is all white or dotted in pristine spots. “Only about 5% of cats have all-white coats,” Dr. Hart says..</p>  
      <p>Though grey is one of the most beautiful colors found in cats, grey cats are not particularly rare. The color grey, which is also called blue, is a dilute variation of black, which is a very common color in cats.
        In cats, grey coats come in a range of hues, from very light silvery grey to deep slate blue. Grey cats also come in a variety of different patterns, including solid grey, grey tabby, grey spotted tabby, grey ticked tabby, grey spotted, grey pointed, and bi-colored (grey with white).</p> 
        <p>The thing that makes a cat orange – and a ginger person ginger – is a natural melanin pigment called pheomelanin. This yellow-red pigment doesn’t mean everyone who has it boasts the same shade of orange fur (or hair) – there is a spectrum of color from white to red – but it does mean that they all belong to a special pigment club.</p>
