This is a single web page created with html and css . The basic idea is to split the width of the page using the flex property in css. So we created a column as a side which contains 30% of the page and a column as a main which contains the other 70% of the page. Also we created a dropdown menu using block and position properties in the css and we added different colours in our classes with hover nd active properties. Finally we use media queries from css to make the page responsive in different pixels width and we transform it from a two to one column after some browser shrinking.
